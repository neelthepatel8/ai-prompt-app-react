## Welcome to Promptyy. 
This is an app built by Neel Patel as a way to learn and understand new web development technologies. 

### Tech Stack:
#### JavaScript
I generally use Typescript for my web dev projects but since a lot of new updates came out in Next JS 13 I wanted to not worry about strict typing for this project, therefore I ended up using Javascript. Future plans to help with understand Typescript more is to change all the javascript code to typescript.

#### NextJS 13
I really wanted to learn the latest industry level framework for building this app. NextJS 13 came out about 2 weeks ago from the time I started building this app. It made me learn new ways to work with the Next api routes, Server / Client side rendering changes and the new App directory structure. 

#### ReactJS
React JS has become the ideal choice for beginner - intermediate web framework choice. I would really like to learn more advanced frameworks like Angular in the future.

#### MongoDB
This was my first time working with MongoDB and NoSQL Database in general. I have worked previously with MySQL and Postgresql. MongoDB is definitely a lot easier to work with and mongoose makes it very smooth to use it with the project. 


### Running the app
